This is carried out as a part of project. 
The code is written in jupyter notebook(colab). Simple utility functions are made and compiled into main.py.
The code is cleaned and presented in the directory clean files.
Other files are a little hard to comprehend files (which are clutter of previous versions of code,and may throw errors as functions are updated, but not wher they were called)
Good results are obtained when run for a long time. aroun 10^5 MC steps.
